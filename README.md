* SourceMod 1.11 or newer
* The [neotokyo.inc](https://github.com/softashell/sourcemod-nt-include) include file is required for compiling
* The pumpkin model/texture assets from the nt-festive-decorations repository must be installed on the server; please see [the related README document](https://github.com/Rainyan/nt-festive-decorations/tree/master/nt-halloween-decorations#installation) for installation instructions.
